<div>Hi! I am Jennifer from Eqqualberry.</div>
<br/>
<div>We really feel thankful to your post and cooperationðŸ˜‰</div>
<br/>
<div>I would appreciate if you could capture and send the viewerâ€™s location/country information of our video :)</div>
<div>Also, I wonder if it would be possible for us to re-post the video on our TikTok sub-account.</div>
<br/>
<div>The tiktok url of the video is below</div>
<div>ãƒ»{}</div>
<br/>
<div>I'll make sure to tag your account when I upload it.</div>
<div>This would be a huge help for usðŸ’–</div>
<br/>
<div>Warmest regards, ðŸŒ·Jennifer</div>
